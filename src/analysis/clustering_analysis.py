# How can I identify significant variables in clustering?
# Variables that "define" clusters -> low intra-cluster variance and high inter-cluster variance
# adjusted rand index???

# Other than InfoShield, do I have other clustering methods available?

# + research q: what is the best way to cluster? Native text, translated text or something completely different?
